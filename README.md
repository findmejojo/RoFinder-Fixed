# RoFinder (fixed)

Roblox decided to delete the endpoints this plugin used. I have fixed it with newer endpoints (may be unstable now)

RoFinder is an experience sniper chrome extension, the entire source code is based on a extension called “BloxSearch” that was used to infect thousands of users but RoFinder has the original source of BloxSearch without the infected code part.

## To install RoFinder (Tested on Chromium browsers):
  1. Download this repository as a zip file.
  1. Go to your extensions page in your browser.
  2. On the top right click “Developer Mode”.
  3. On the top left click “Load Unpacked”.
  4. Extract the zip file and press “Select Folder” then select the “src” folder inside the unzipped folder.
 
## To use RoFinder:
  1. Head to any game that you think someone is inside.
  2. Locate the textbox under the “Servers” Tab, it should be on the top part before the server list.
  3. Type the username of the roblox player in the textbox (Not the display name).
  4. Press the Search Button.
  5. If the server is found then it would highlight it under the Server List with a green border or if the user isn’t found it would say “Target not found!”.
